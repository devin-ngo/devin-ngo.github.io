      "contents": "\nI am am a first-year Master’s candidate at the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies. My outside concentration was focused on Climate Change. At Bren, my interests are in the area of Energy and Climate. I am also interested incorporating environmental justice in the work I do to address the disproportionate effects disadvantaged communities face from environmental impacts.\nIn terms of past experience in the environmental field, I interned for the City of Sunnyvale’s Environmental Services Department in the summer of 2019. I revamped the Sunnyvale Water Pollution Control Plant’s Operations and Maintenance Manuals, migrating them to the digital platform, Confluence. Additionally, I spent the summer of 2021 as an intern under the U.S. Department of Energy’s Clean Cities University Workforce Development Program. With Silicon Valley Clean Cities Coalition, I worked on organizing events and initiatives that implemented and increased the awareness of alternative fuels and fuel-saving technologies.\n\n\n\n",
