## Overview

#### Summary 

In 2018, Michelle Zauner wrote an essay for the New Yorker about her connections with the Korean supermarket, H Mart, to her late mother. This piece later turned into a full-book that debuted on the The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list. Text analysis will be performed on the original New Yorker article to find the most common words in this article to be put into a word cloud. Furthermore, sentiment analysis will be done on the text using the NRC Emotion Lexicon. The NRC Emotion Lexicon is a list that associates English words to two sentiments (negative and positive) and eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust).

## Setup
```{r setup, include = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(textdata)
library(pdftools)
library(ggwordcloud)
library(here)
```

```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
# Reading in text
hmart_text <- pdf_text(here("_posts", "2022-03-13-textanalysis", "data", "crying_in_hmart.pdf"))
```

## Text Wrangling

```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
# Breaking text down into pages and lines
hmart_lines <- data.frame(hmart_text) %>% 
  mutate(page = 1:n()) %>% 
  mutate(full_text = str_split(hmart_text, pattern = '\\n')) %>% 
  unnest(full_text) %>% 
  mutate(full_text = str_squish(full_text))
```

```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
# Getting word counts and wrangling to eliminate stop words
hmart_words <- hmart_lines %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, full_text, token = 'words') %>% 
  select(-hmart_text) 

hmart_wordcount <- hmart_words %>% 
  count(word) 

hmart_words_clean <- hmart_words %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") 
  
nonstop_counts <- hmart_words_clean %>% 
  count(word)
```

## Word Cloud

```{r}
# Creating a word cloud of the most frequent 100 words
hmart_top100 <- nonstop_counts %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  slice(1:100)

hmart_cloud <- ggplot(data = hmart_top100, aes(label = word)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud(aes(color = n, size = n), shape = 'diamond') +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 6) +
  scale_colour_gradientn(colors = c('lightblue3', 'lightblue4', 'midnightblue'))

hmart_cloud
```

**Takeaways:**

- The most common word found in the article was "Korean", showing the emphasis on Korean culture linked between Zauner's Korean mother, Korean food, and the Korean supermarket, H Mart
- A lot of the words repeating were associated with food including "food" itself as well as "noodles", "rice", "pork", "banchan", and "eating"
- Other repeating words included "mom" and "mother", given the subject matter of her article. "Family", "country", and "asian" are a few of the common words that also indicate how this article deals with Zauner's identity and culture 

## Sentiment Analysis 

```{r}
hmart_nrc <- hmart_words_clean %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments('nrc'))

hmart_nrc_counts <- hmart_nrc %>% 
  count(sentiment) %>% 
  arrange(-n) 

ggplot(hmart_nrc_counts, 
       aes(x = fct_reorder(sentiment, n), y = n, fill = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("pink", "pink1", "pink2")) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Sentiment", y = "Count")
```

**Takeaways:**

- Despite the article dealing with grief, there were more counts of words with positive associations than negative. This possibly correlates with Zauner's fond memories of her mother being more present in the article rather than discussing her mother's death
- Words associated with trust, joy, and anticipation also correlate to Zauner's relationship with her mother 
- Words with negative associations, along with those that are associated with sadness and fear are unsurprisingly present considering the sensitive subject matter of the article
