Welcome to my personal website where I will be tracking the progress I make entering the world of data science! I first began learning R in my first quarter of graduate school at UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, through a course on data analysis. I am currently taking another course this quarter to further advance my skills in data anlaysis and using R. (To add more later...)
