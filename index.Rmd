I am a Master's Candidate at the UCSB Bren School Environmental Science and Management. I am planning to specialize in Energy and Climate, and reside in the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently, I am seeking opportunities in the summer to explore my interests in climate and energy-related fields. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music on my record player, watching movies, and rooting for my local sport teams. This website is a project from my data analysis class and I am looking forward to taking the next step in advancing my skills.
